    The following list won't indent no matter what I try:
    - A 2012 study by Mumbai’s Tata Memorial Hospital found that 52.1 per cent of lung cancer patients had no history of smoking. 
    - The study contrasted this with a Singapore study that put the number of non-smoking lung cancer patients at 32.5 per cent, and another in the US that found the number to be about 10 per cent.
    - The Tata Memorial study found that 88 per cent of female lung cancer patients were non-smokers, compared with 41.8 per cent of males. It concluded that in the case of non-smokers, environmental and genetic factors were implicated.

    - In January 2017, researchers at AIIMS, Bhubaneswar, published a demographic profile of lung cancer in eastern India, which found that 48 per cent of patients had not been exposed to active or passive smoking
    - 89 per cent of women patients had never smoked, while the figure for men was 28 per cent.
    - From available research, very little is understood about lung cancer among non-smokers in India. “We need more robust data to identify how strong is the risk and link,” Guleria of AIIMS says.
